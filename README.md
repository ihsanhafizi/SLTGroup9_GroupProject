A student attendance management system is a digital tool to track and report student attendance. Attendance is important for monitoring student engagement, behaviour, and discipline. Traditional methods like manual sign-in sheets is time consuming and prone to errors. 

An online attendance system solves these problems by:

1. Verifying users through login authentication
2. Recording attendance by lecturers
3. Allowing students to check-in
4. Viewing attendance records easily
5. Generating reports for analysis
